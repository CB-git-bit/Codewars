# String Removal Function

This repository contains a SQL function that removes the first and last characters of a string. The function takes a single parameter, the original string, and returns a modified string without the first and last characters.

## Function Details

### Function Name

remove_outer_characters

### Input Parameter

- `var`: The original string from which the first and last characters will be removed.

### Output

The function returns a modified string that excludes the first and last characters.

### Assumptions

The function assumes that the input string has a length of at least two characters. Strings with fewer than two characters will not be modified.

## Usage

To use the function, follow these steps:

1. Create the function in your PostgreSQL database using the provided SQL code.

2. Ensure that the function is created successfully without any errors.

3. Once the function is created, you can call it in your SQL queries.

4. To remove the first and last characters from the strings in the "removechar" table, execute the following query:

```sql
SELECT s, remove_outer_characters(s) AS res
FROM removechar;
```

This query retrieves the "s" column from the "removechar" table and applies the "remove_outer_characters" function to each value, storing the modified string in the "res" column of the result.

## Initial Attempt Issues

The initial attempt to create the function had the following problems:

1. Syntax errors: The syntax used in the original code was not valid SQL syntax. For example, the use of `IF` without a corresponding `BEGIN` and `END`, and multiple `SELECT` statements without proper separation.

2. Data type mismatch: The input parameter `@VAR` was declared as `CHAR`, which has a fixed length. However, it is more appropriate to use `VARCHAR` or `NVARCHAR` for string manipulation as they can accommodate variable-length strings.

3. Missing variable declaration: No variables were declared to store intermediate results in the original code. In the corrected code, a `@RESULT` variable was added to store the modified string.

4. Inefficient character removal: The original code attempted to remove the first and last characters separately using the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` functions. However, this approach is unnecessary and less efficient than using the `SUBSTRING` function, as it requires two separate function calls.

5. Lack of a proper `RETURN` statement: The original code attempted to return the intermediate results using multiple `SELECT` statements. However, in a SQL function, a single `RETURN` statement is needed to return the final result.

To address these issues, the provided SQL code offers a corrected and efficient solution that meets the requirements of removing the first and last characters from a string.

Please note that a scalar user-defined function was used to meet the requirements of the problem, taking the original string as input.
